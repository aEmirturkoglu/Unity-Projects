Bank Management System Technical Report:
1. Executive Summary
This report presents an analysis of a C-based Bank Management System that combines administrative banking functions with ATM services. The system provides basic account management, transaction processing, and customer self-service capabilities. While functional, the system requires significant enhancements to meet industry standards for security, scalability, and user experience.
2. Introduction
2.1 Purpose
The purpose of this report is to analyze the existing Bank Management System, identify its key features and limitations, and propose areas for improvement.
2.2 Scope
This report covers the system's functionality, technical implementation, and potential enhancements. It does not include a detailed code review or implementation plan for improvements.
3. System Overview
3.1 Key Components

Account Management Module
Transaction Processing Module
ATM Service Module
Data Storage and Retrieval System
User Interface

3.2 Primary Functions

Create, update, and close bank accounts
Process deposits and withdrawals
